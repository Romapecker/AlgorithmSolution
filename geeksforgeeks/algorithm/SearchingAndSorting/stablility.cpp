/* Stablity
 * stable:   Insertion Sort, Buddle Sort, Merge Sort
 * unstable: Quick Sort, Heap Sort
 */

/* Quick Sort worst occurs
 * 1. Array is already sorted in same order (reverse order)
 * 2. All elements are same
 */

/* Lower Bound on comparsion based sorting algorithms:
 * O(nlogn)
 */

/* Which sorting algorithm makes minimum number of memory writes
 * quick sort
 */
